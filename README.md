# React Native Undefined Property Error

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: attempting to access a property of an object before it's been properly initialized.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected version. This issue often arises due to asynchronous operations or component lifecycle timing.

## Problem

The initial state of a component or data from an API call might not be immediately available when the component renders.  Accessing a property of this object before it's populated leads to the `undefined is not an object` error.

## Solution

The solution typically involves ensuring the data is available before accessing its properties. This can be achieved using the following techniques:

* **Conditional Rendering:** Check if the object and its property exist before rendering the related UI elements.
* **State Management:** Utilize a state management solution (like Redux, Context API, or Zustand) to ensure data is loaded and available before accessing it in the component.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Employ `async/await` or `.then()` to handle asynchronous data fetching and update the component's state once the data is ready.
* **Lifecycle Methods:** Make use of lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` or `useEffect` to load data after the component has mounted.
